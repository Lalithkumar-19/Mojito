- ⚡ **Vite**: Next-generation front-end tool with instant server start and lightning-fast HMR.
- 🎞️ **GSAP**: Industry-standard animation library with robust timeline control.
- 🌀 **ScrollTrigger (GSAP plugin)**: For scroll-linked animations and pinning effects.
- ✨ **Smooth performance**: Designed and optimized for GPU-accelerated animations.
- 📦 **Modular structure**: Scalable file organization for larger projects.
- ✅ **ESLint + Prettier**: For code quality and consistent formatting.
